Goals
Draw multiple shapes: The program will display at least 10 circles moving across the screen.
Dynamic updates: Each shape will:
Move in different directions.
Change color over time.
Adjust size cyclically.
Conditionals: Ensure the shapes stay within the canvas by reversing direction when they hit the edges.
Advanced Features
Smooth color transitions for the shapes.
Size oscillation using mathematical functions.
Interaction with the mouse (e.g., clicking might change the speed or direction of the shapes).
